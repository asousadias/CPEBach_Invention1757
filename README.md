## Description:
This Max patch implements the _Invention_ from C. Ph.-E. Bachnin real time.<br>
Experiments started in the late 80's with _GFA Basic_ for the Atari ST computer driving MIDI synthesizers.<br>
In 2000 I've reprogrammed it in Max. At the time, the challenge was to make available a score in real-time.

## Operation
Lanch the _\_CP-EBach_Invention1757.maxpat_ patch. Generate a score and play. Enjoy.

## History:
- 2018, May: Release on GitHub. Minor changes to conform Max7.
- 2000: Max version.
- 1986-88: Initial design and programming in GFA Basic (Atari ST).
